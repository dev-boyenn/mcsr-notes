## Match 1 : Agoc : Lose ( perch race, bad halfbow )
* Stone pick shears overworlds : use shears before digging down, tower up with leaves
* Crafted garrots during housing hole cleanup instead of waiting to craft bed + iron axe + garrot at chest
* Didnt do zero prep at spawner ( no time ), should have done in overworld2
* Didnt pillar at all during halfbow, missing most shots
* Lose perch race while entering end over a minute earlier. more crystals should basically have guaranteed the win
## Match 2: 765blabla : Win ( ff )
* Remembered to hang off block sticking out of underwater tnt to not get sucked in peepoHappy
* Don't remove iron pressure plate from hotbar, either throw it or intend to use it
* Crafted blazebed during first clear again, but kind of correct this time ? didnt need iron axe or anything else from chests to craft
* While looking for obby : skipped string, crying, and crossbow
* Lowered RD to fort too early, pearl first then insta lower
* doing wool craft with blazebed already crafted 
* yikes actually I just straight up craft a second blazebed
* easy W
## Match 3: 100ksup : Win ( Halfbow )
* scuffed af 2x1 1 deep
* no clearing during pearls
* again lowered RD before pearl throw to fort
* prioritise spawner blazes over strays, especially when can keep spawner loaded
* did zero prep during portal instead of after returning ( 5 rods )
* didnt realise perch during halfbow, had to play for second perch

## Match 4: Devidow
* no thin macro punish
* forgot momentum jump thing on treasure
* split pearls and string too early, losing time to setup hang
* didnt craft iron axe and blazebed before returning to trades
